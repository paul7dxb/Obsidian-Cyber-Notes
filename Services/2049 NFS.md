# Enumeration
## Useful nmap scripts
nfs-ls #List NFS exports and check permissions
nfs-showmount #Like showmount -e
nfs-statfs #Disk statistics and info from NFS share
## Useful metasploit modules
scanner/nfs/nfsmount #Scan NFS mounts and list permissions
## Mounting
To know which folder has the server available to mount you an ask it using:
```bash
showmount -e <IP>
```
Then mount it using:
```bash
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] <ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder> -o nolock
```
You should specify to use version 2 because it doesn't have any authentication or authorization.
Example:
```bash
mkdir /mnt/new_back
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] 10.12.0.150:/backup /mnt/new_back -o nolock
```

## Permissions
If you mount a folder which contains files or folders only accesible by some user (by UID). You can create locally a user with that UID and using that user you will be able to access the file/folder.
NSFShell
To easily list, mount and change UID and GID to have access to files you can use nfsshell.
Nice NFSShell tutorial.
