CIA
- Confid
- Hiding data at rest
- Integrity
	- Ensure data hasn't been altered
- Availability
	- Protect systems from flooding
- Non-repudiation
	- Ensures original sender cannot deny sending data
		- Digital signatures

Layers

Symmetric
- Same key
- Efficient and fast
- Inexpensive computationally
- Shorter key length
- Key management more complex
- DOes not scale well

Asymmetric
- Mathematically related pair
- Efficient key management
- Scalable
- Longer key lengths
- Slower and more computationally expensive


## Characteristics of Cryptographic Keys
- Keyspace = total number of mathematical possibilites in the set
	- 2^n
- Static
	- Used for long period
	- OSPF/BGP
	- Multiople time
- Session key
	- Used for specific session
	- cryptanalytic attacks more difficult
- Ephemeral keys
	- Used for one key establishment process
	- Never stored in memory. Not retained
- Key Stretching
	- PBKDF2 / BCRYPT
	- Password + salt many times
- Kerberos 4096 iterations

**Weaknesses of crypto:
Key management and human implementation**


## Block vs Stream Cipher Suites
Block
- Fixed blocks of data
- Use padding
- DES
- 3DES
- AES-CBC
- AES_GBC
- Blowfish
- Cipher Block Chaining
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012174540.png)
- Counter mode
	- Generates pseudo random nonce
	- Used once with a given key
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012174642.png)

- Galois Counter Mode
- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012174732.png)
-  Authenticated Encryption Authenticated Decryption
- Auth tag to give authenticity of data

Stream data cipher
- Xor with keystream bits
- Faster
- Fish
- CryptMT
- Scream
- RC4


AES
- Replaced DES
- Block cipher
- CBC and GCM modes most common

## Cryptographic Hasing
- Strength is half of bit size
- Avalanche effect - small change in input for big change in output

- Use HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) verify sender information
	- Uses hashing (H) with secret key (MAC)

## Key Exchange Mechanisms
- Asymmetric key exchange
	- RSA
	- Diffie-Helmen (DHKE)
		- two parties over unsecure channel
	- Elliptic curve DIffie-Helman
		- Most efficient
		- Smaller key with more strength
	- Ephemeral Diffie-Helman
		- Give forward secrecy
		- Can also be used with elliptic curve

## Modes of Operation
- Crypto can be authenticated
	- HMAC for origin authentication
- GCM
	- Only gives confidentiality
- Some use counter
- Ephemeral
	- Forward secrecy
- Perfect FOrward Secrecy
	- IPSec
	- Compromise of long term does not allow attacker to obtain past session keys
- Lightweight cryptography
	- Sensor networks
	- IoT
	- Lighter mechanisms needed

## Advanced Cryptography Concepts
- Digital certificates
	- Authenticity, integrity and non repudiation
	- Not offer confidentiality
- Quantum computer
	- qubits
- Post quantum crypto
	- Rsistant to attacks from quantum computer
	- Lattice spaced crypto
	- Increase size of keys
- Quantum communications
	- protect data
	- QKD (Quantum key distribution)
	- Decryption key sent in quantum state
- Homomorphic Encryption
	- Protect data in use
	- Remains encrypted while being processed
	- Algebraic system to allow operations to take place on it
- Blockchain
	- data, time and amount
	- transactions verified

## Common Use Cases and Limitations
- Low power -> low latency and high resiliency
	- lightweight crypto and elliptic curve
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Obfuscation
	- When someone knows underlying technology hiding crypto keys underneath
- Authentication
- Non repudiation

Limitations
- Speed
- Size on suppported key space
- Weak keys
- Time
- Longevity
	- Longer used more likely to be brute forced
- Predicability
	- Weak passwords
- Key reuse
- Entropy
	- Neutralise structure of output
- Computational overhead

## PKI
- Web of Trust
- Trusted introducer

- CSR: Certificate signing request

## Types of Certificates
- X.509v3 format
	- Version number
	- Serial number
		- Used to revoke certificates
	- Signature algortihm ID
	- Issuer name
		- Could be CA in domain
	- Valid to and from
	- Subject name
	- Public key infor
		- algorithm
		- public key
	- Extensions
	- Certificate signature and algorithm used
	- Certificate extensions

		- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221013070254.png)

- Types of certificate
	- Wildcard: Multiple sub domains
		- \*.mycompany.com
	- Subject Alternate Name (SAN)
		- Additional names based on email, IP, DNS names
	- Code signing
		- Authenticate source and integrity of code
	- Self signed certificates
		- Used by root CAs
	- Email (S/MIME)
	- Machine / Computer
		- Authenticate device to network
	- User

- Certificate Validation

## Core PKI Concepts
- CA Trust model
	- Single CA
		- Directly provide certificates to everyone
		- Always online
	- Hierarchical
		- Root CA and intermediate CAs
		- Root can be online or offline
			- Offline: apply certificates using removable media
	- Revocation and suspension
		- All keys have finties life due to brute force
		- Revoked (permanent)
		- Suspended (temporary): Can be reactivated
			- Loss of device then found
		- CRL Certificate Revocation List
			- Issue by CA who issued CA
			- Published periodically
			- Time gap between CRL and client downloading
		- OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
			- List of not valid certificates
			- Generated and published immediately
			- Database can be queried 24/7
	- Certificate Stapling
		- Certificate containes a time-stamped OCSP response
		- Owner pays for stapling
	- Certficiate Pinning
		- Allow list of digital certificates
		- Only pinned certificates are trusted
		- Used in hostile enironment or need to be 100% sure of remote host identity
	- Common cryto best practices
		- Use trusted CA
		- Validate certificate chains
		- consider OCSP
		- Key management
		- MSSP (third party PKI management)
