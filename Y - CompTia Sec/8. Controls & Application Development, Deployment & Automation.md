# 8. Controls & Application Development & Automation

## Categories of Controls
- NIST SP 800-53
	- Managerial
		- Administrative controls
		- Published in policies
		- Training programmes
	- Operational
		- Change and configuration management database
		- Conducting training
		- Physical and environmental controls
		- incident response
		- disaster recovery
	- Technical
		- Security mechanisms that systems run
		- CIA protections

## Types of Controls
- Preventative
	- Counter measure from atttacker delivering payload
	- IPS
- Detective
	- ID security violations
	- IDS
- Corrective
	- React to detection to eliminate opportunity
- Deterrent
	- Warnings of consequences
	- Presence of other controls can be a deterent
- Compensating
	- Assist other controls
	- Data loss prevention to email agent

## Secure Application Environments
- Secure by design
	- SDLC - Secure development life cycle
- Secure by Deployment
	- Put into an environment where security is in network
	- Air gapped
- Secure by default
	- Disabling insecure functions

## Provisioning and Deprovisioning
- Providing or removing software access on an as needed basis
- Prevent privilege creep
- Enablers
	- automation
	- auto sclaing
	- VMs and containers
	- rapid deployment agile, spiral
	- Hybrid as a cloud

## Integrity Measurement
- NIST SP 800-155 - BIOS integrity
- Check for digitially signed codes and programs
- Use Linux IMA (Integrity measurement architecture) subsystem
	- Kernel hashes of files
- Trusted Computing Base Solutions (TPM)
- Execution validation
- WS-Secuirity (WSS)
	- SOAP extension
	- Allows commuinication of authentication formats

## Secure Coding Techniques
- Normalization
	- error handling
	- Input validation
	- Ensure there is no data redundancy and similar components are stored together
- Camoflage / obfuscation
- Dead code
	- remove unneccessar code
- Memory management
	- Counter buffer overflow
	- Memory leak
		- NX bit (never execute)
		- Address space layout randomisation (ASLR)
- Data exposure
	- Abstract origianl data. Act on a view of the original data
	- Access control and least privilege
	- Sign API calss
	- Emply DLPs (Data Loss Prevention)
- Stored procedures

## OWASP for Application Development
- Open Web Application Security Project
- OWASP MSTG (mobile secuuirty testing guide)

## Software Diversity
- Methodology where two or more functionally duplicate versions are developed from same specification
- Made by different teams
- Low level code is more liekly to be exploited
- Diversity decreases attack surface size

## Automation and scripting in application developement
- Continuous monitoring
- Validation
	- Finding bugs
- Integration
	- Tools to run code analysis tests
- Delivery
- Deployment
	- Containers
	- Functions as a service
