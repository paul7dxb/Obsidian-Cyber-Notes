# 10. Implementing Identity and Account Management & AAA Solutions

## Identity Controls
- IdP: Identity Providers
	- system service that provides single set of login credentials that works over platforms
		- Facebook ligin
	- Uses translation and assertion services
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012063949.png)
- 3 types of identity controls
	- Tokens
	- Assertions
		- Azure Shared Access Signature
		- SAML 2.0
	- Certificates
		- X.509v3

## Acount Types
- ACcount Types
	- User
	- Guest & generic
	- Shared accounts and credentials
	- Service and application accounts
	- Energency (fallback) account
		- RADIUS
- Rootkits can create and install hidden accounts
- Dual operator pronciples for certain activities
	- Two different accounts to perform an action

## Common Account Policies
- IAM
	- Identity and Access Management
	- AWS uses Managed policies to assign permissions

## Advanced Account Policies
- Geofencing and geolocation
	- Device useage by location
- May disable
	- Geolocation from metdata
- Mobile Device Management (MDM)
	- Time of day restricitons
	- GPS tags
- Risk based attribute based access control (ABAC)
	- fine grained authorization
		- Policy and attributes for that policy (limitations (value of transfers))

## Authentication Mangement
- Key management is main vulnerability to cryptosystems
- AUP: Acceptable Use Policy
- Password vault == Password Manager
- Trusted Computing (TC) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)
	- TPM: Trusted Platform Module
		- module embedded in a system
		- tamper resistent security chip
	- SED: self encrypting drive
		- aka Full disk encryption
		- Cannot be turned off
		- Less susceptable than software based
	- HSM: dedicated crypto processor
		- Hardware Security Module
		- Physcial or virtualised (HSA: hardware security abstraction)
- KBS: Knowledge based authentication
	- secuirty questions
	- Info that only user can know
	- Dynamic KBA
		- Generate questions from credit history or public records (out of wallet)

## Common Authentication Protocols
- PAP: Password Authentication Protocol
	- Authentication phase before network layer
	- First send LCP during MAC establishment
	- 2 way hand shake
- MS-CHAPv2
	- Challenge Authentication Protocol
	- Secure PPP in a tunnel
		- Uses GRE Generic routing encapsulation
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012073558.png)
	- Use weak 56 bit DES encryption
- IEE 802.1x (PNAC)
	- Port based network access control
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012073707.png)
	- Initially send out EAPOL frames
		- Extensible Auithentication protocol over the LAN
	- EAP
	- PEAP
	- EAP-FAST (Cisco)
	- EAP-TLS
		- x509 certificates
	- EAP TTLS (tunneling)
		- Highest level of security
		- Requires deplyment of certificates
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012074029.png)
- RADIUS
	- Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
	- Enables remote access server to communicate with central server to authenticate users and authorize
	- Client server modfel
		- client is a router or AP
	- use shared secret between client and server ich is never sent over network. Only password is encrypted
	- UDP 1812 (authentication)
	- UDP 1813 (accounting)
	- Earlier was 1645 and 1646
	- RADIUS server sends authentication and what user can do back to client router

## Authentication Protocols for Federation
- SAML (Security Assertions Markup Language)
- OAuth
- (OIDC) OpenID Connect
- Shibboleth
- Kerberos

- SAML (Security Assertions Markup Language)
	- Based for web pages
	- XML based
	- SOAP simple object access protocol
	- Open source
	- Used with SaaS
	- Identity provider gives assertion and gives to service provider
- OAuth
	- JSON
	- publish and iteract with protected data
- (OIDC) OpenID Connect
	- Identity layer on top of OAuth
	- Verifies end user ID
	- Basic profile info
	- Web based, mobile and JS
	- Extensions can be added
- Shibboleth
	- Inter/intraorganisational connection
	- univeristy / public
- Kerberos
	- AD 
	- Replaced NTLM
	- Ticket
	- Mutual authentication
	- All communication encrypted
	- KDC Key Distribution Center 3rd party
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221012125141.png)

## Access Control Schemes
- (DAC) Discretionary Access Control
	- Restricts access to data based on identity or group
	- Usually owner can change permissions
- RBAC (Role based Access Control)
	- Based on org chart, roles and responsibilities
	- Framework set by admins not user
	- Negatives
		- Scope creep
		- Roles must be audited
		- Multi tenancy capabilities need AD OUs
- (RB-RBAC) Rule Based Access Control
	- Dynamically assigned roles
	- Can be time based (e.g access only 6-6 mon - fri)
	- Common in routers, switches
	- Stateless or stateful
	- `access-list 100 permit tcp any IP eq ftp-data`
- (MAC) Mandatory Access Control
	- Strict non-discretionary model
	- Subjects and Objects
	- Assigns sensitivity labels
	- "need to know"
		- minimise scope creep
		- Bell-LaPadula
