# 14. Implementing Secure Network Designs

## Network Segmentation And Zoning
- Mitigate rish of oen network
- Control access to / from zone
- Each vlan is contained in one zone
- Permiters has zone interface points
	- firewalls
- Zone
	- RZ: Restricted zone
	- OZ: OPerational zone
	- PAZ/DMZ: Public access zone
	- PZ: Public zone
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221013171208.png)
- Private vlans help mitigate layer 2 spread of malware
- Zone is one or more vlans
- Honeynet VLAN
	- Trap attackers
	- Entice malicious users to connect
	- Isolated site
- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221013171335.png)
- Extranets
- Network with resources under control of another organisation that your organisation needs access to


## Load Balancing Techniques
- Obtimize application availability
- Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- Offer failover solutions
- Available in cloud services
	- network load balancing
	- application load balancing
	- Reach load balancer when acccessing from browser
	- Provide flow logs
	- TLS listener

## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Dedicated termination points
	- Concentrators
- Types
	- Site to site
	- Remote access
	- Always on VPN
- IPSec IKE v1/2 & SSL/TLS protocol suites
	- Tunnel mode or transport mode
- Routers and firewalls can be VPN gateway
- AH: Authentication header 
- ESP: Ecapsualtion Security Payload
	- Confidentiality
- IPv6 must support AH and ESP
- Split tunnel
	- Access resources in DMZ
- Full tunnel
	- Everything back to HQ
- Can be CSP based
	- Usually Static or BGP routing

## Port Security
- Switches
	- Layers 2-4
	- Switch port security
		- switchport access vlan 500
		- switchport port-security maximum
			- Prevent mac flooding
		- shutdown mode
		- protected
			- Can't talk to other ports on switch
	- Loop prevention
	- Flood guard with (BPDU) Bridge Protocol Datu Units
	- VLANS and PVLANS
		- Compartmentalize without changing IP addressing
- MACsec with GMAC
- PNAC (Port-based network access control)
	- 802.1X

## Firewalls
- Layers 2-7
- Between all zones, domains and partitions
- Network or application firewall
- Application firewall can filter packet data
- Restrictive vs permissive
	- Restrictive: drop by default add rules to allow
- Stateless
	- IP packet filter
	- Look at packets one at a time d check rules
- Stateful
	- Track connections
	- Usually allow to initiate from trusted domain and then allow back in

Next Generation Firewall
- Layers 5-7
- Deep packet inspection
- Authentication Proxy
	- LDAP to AD
	- Filter by user in AD
- Identity services
	- ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control)
- UTM (Unified Threat Management)
- URL filtering
	- Block websites
- Botnet filtering

Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Appliance, server plugin
- Apply rules to HTTP connection
- WebACLs filter for common web attacks
- Examples
	- Akamai
	- Fortinet
	- Cloudflare


## Network Appliances
- Defence in depth in one unit
- Combine features and services by processing frames and packets in processing order
- Network Admission Control (NAC)
- **Bastion host** or jump hosts
	- Accept SSH or RDP for servers
- Proxy servers
- Network IPS sensors
- Port mirroring / spanning taps
	- For IDS or SIEM
- Malware control
	- Check against cloud providers
- VPN gateways
- SIEM appliance
- NetFlow colllectors

## Advanced Network Environment Solutions
- Data Activity Monitoring (DAM)
	- Reports and identifies fraudulent behaviour
	- minimal or no impact on user operation
	- Can send data to SIEM
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
	- Lightweight sensor
	- Palo Alto Traps
	- Behavioural analytics
	- Honey tokens
- HMS (Hardware Security Modules)
	- Crypto processing
	- secure crypto keys
	- Instead of software crypto libraries
