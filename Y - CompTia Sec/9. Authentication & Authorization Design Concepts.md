# 9. Authentication & Authorization Design Concepts

## Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
- Authentication
	- Validate identity
	- Origin (origin of packet)
		- Follow up with more advanced layers of authentication
- Authorization
	- Granting authenticated entity permission
- Accounting
	- Billing and chargeback
		- Budgets
	- Auditing and reporting

## Character vs Packet Mode
- Network authenticing device
- Character
	- Send keystrokes to network device
	- Configuring and commands
- packet mode
	- Interface mode or link protocol session
	- Communicate with device on other side of authenticating device
	- Midiated access

## Directory Services
- AD components
	- Schema
		- Limits, formatting of naming convention
	- Global catalog
		- Global catalog of all objects
	- Query and indexing service
	- Service to replicate data across network
		- DC

- LDAP
	- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
	- Often used for accesss to management app and browsers

- Securing the directory
	- Least privilege
	- Pysical security
	- Seperate admin accounts
	- Just in time admin passwords
		- Laps tool
	- Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
	- MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) for admin / power users
	- TLS IPSec for data in transit
	- CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)

## Federation and Attestation
- Trust between ID provider (AD) and some service
- Attestation using tokens and assertions

## Authentication Technologies
- 2FA
	- Time based one time password
	- Software based token (google authenticator)
	- HOTP (HMAC based one time password)
	- SMS
	- Token key
- Static Codes
- Authentication applications like lastpass
- Push Notifications

## Smart Card Authentication
- From of 2FA
- Contact card to host computer
	- Common Access Card (CAC)

## Biometrics
- Part of MFA (multi factor authentication)
- Fingerprints
- Facial Recognition
	- non intrusive
	- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
		- fast with low computational overhead
- Retinal scan
	- Invasive (close to eye piece)
- Iris scan
	- colour and size of pupil
	- Camera technology with IR light
	- **More widely accepted as a commericial modality**

- Voice recognition
	- Speech recognition
	- Speaker recognition
		- aural aspects of speech that are unique to person
- Vein analyisis
	- Palm, finger, retina
- Gait analysis
	- non invasive
- Accuracy
	- FAR: False acceptance rate (false positive)
		- Number of false acceptance / number of authentication attempts
	- FRR: False rejection rate
		- Reject authentic user
	- CER: crossover error rate
		- Value of FAR and FRR when sensitivity is setup so FAR and FRR are the same
		- Used to compare biometrics

## Multi Factor Authentication
- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something you are
- ABAC: Attribute based 
	- somewhere you are
	- Something you can do (VPN connection, use root)
	- Something you can exhibit

## Cloud vs On-premise Authentication & Authentication
- Cloud concerned with layer 3 and above
- On premise starts at physical edge of campus
