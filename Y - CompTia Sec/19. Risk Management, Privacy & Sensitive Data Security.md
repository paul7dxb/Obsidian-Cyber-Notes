# 19. Risk Management, Privacy & Sensitive Data Security

## Risk Types

- Structured threats
	- Planned
	- Organised
	- Persistent
		- Long term attack with variants
	- Multi phase
	- Polymorphic
	- Internal or external
	- Exploit kits, zero days, cryptoware, cryptojacking

- Unstructured
	- Accidental
	- Drive by web surfing
	- Poor AUP
	- Poor awareness
	- Email
	- USBs and personal electronics

- Internal risks
	- Poor physical security
	- Lacking MFA
	- Not enforcing security policy
	- Lack of auditing and monitoring
	- Poor patch, configuration and change management
	- Absence of endpoint detection and response tools

- Multiparty risk
	- Thrid party risk
	- Greater regulatory emphasis on 
		- Need to consider every element of supply chain

## Risk Management Types

- Risk acceptance
	- Do not implement the safeguards
	- Justification in writing is required
	- Business case to accept risk
- Risk avoidance
	- Choose to not undertake action that introduce risk
		- Not making product available online
- Risk transference/sharing
	- Pass risk to third party
- Risk mitigation
	- Implement safeguards that willl eliminate or reduce risk exposure
	- Cost benefit anlysis

## Risk Analysis

- Inherent (total) risk
	- Risk if safeguard is not implemented
- Residual risk
	- Risk that remains onc safeguard in place
- **Residual = inherent risk - safeguards (controls)**

- Assessing Risk
	- Inventory and categorization
		- Tangible
		- Intangible
			- People
			- Reputation
	- Value
		- Revenue lost when not available
		- Liabilities
	- RIsk to assets
		- Vulnerabilities, threats
	- Work from (to maximise work foce)
		- Most likely to least likely
		- Most valuable to least valuable

- Risk register = Risk ledger = Risk log
	- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221016062503.png)

- Qualatative RIsk ANalysis
	- Descriptive approach
	- Subjective opinions and expert judgement
	- Best practices and learning from others
	- NIST
	- Delphi methods
	- Heatmap
		- Impact vs Likelihood
		- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221016062653.png)

- Quantatative
	- Based on
		- Asset value (including intabgible)
		- Impact and magnitude
		- Liklihood of occurance
		- Costs of effectiveness
		- Monte Carlo simulations
	- Calculating
		- AV (Asset Value)
		- EF (Exposure Factor) : % of asset loss caused by threat
		- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) : Potential Loss If Attack Occurs
			- **SLE = AV x EV**
		- ARO (Annual Rate of Occurance) : Frequency threat will occur in a year
		- ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)
			- **ALE = SLE x ARO**

## Disaster Types & Classifications

- Disaster Types
	- Environmental
	- Man made intentional
	- Man made unintentional
		- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221016063715.png)

## Business Impact Analysis
- Risk assessment aspect of the BCP (Business continuity plan)
	- ID critical functions of business and prioritize them
- ID risk associated with critical functions
	- Probability of occurance (likelihood)
	- Impact of risk (magnitude)
- ID how to eliminate risk

- RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
	- Amount of trime available to recover a resource, service or function
	- Must be equal or less than MTF (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)
- RPO (recovery Point Objective)
	- Point in time relative to disaster where recovery process begins
	- Usually last backup point
	- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221016071236.png)

- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
	- Measure how reliable hardware or component is
	- Usually 1000's of hourse
- MTTR (Mean TIme To Repair)
	- (Total down time) / (number of breakdowns)
- MTD (Maximum Tolerable DOwntime)
	- Absolute maximum time before loss starts to occur
	- Loss
		- Financial
		- Life
		- Legal
		- Reputation
		- Property

## Privacy Breach Consequences
- Causes
	- Cyber attacks
	- Device loss or theft
	- Employee theft / leakage
	- Human error
- Consequences
	- Producttivity
		- Reduction in ability to do primary job
	- Response
		- Expense. Legal, PR, swarm team
	- Replacement
	- Fines and judgements
	- Competitive advantage
		- Increase in loan cost
		- Higher insurance
	- Reputation / good will

## Data Type Classification
![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221016072540.png)

## Data Security Roles & Responsibilities
- Chief Privacy Officer
	- Ultimate responsibilty for protecting data
- Owner
	- Often creator
	- Determine classification
	- Can be a team in MAC model
- Steward
	- Manager of data and metadata
	- Ensure compliance (standards  / controls)
- Custodian
	- Keeper of the information
	- Ensure CIA maintained
	- Technical
- Processor
	- Handle data entry and input
	- May be automated (scripts / batch)

## Privacy Enhancing Technologies
- Tokenization
	- Remove directly identifing elements
	- Replace raw data with randomly generated tokens
	- Mostly deployed with structured data
		- Payment cards
		- Social security numbers
	- Original data does not leave enterprise
	- Can be used with encryption

- Data Minimization
	- Don't collect or keep data unless it is critical
	- Only use as much data as is required to acheive task
	- Gererally cannot repurpose data for another task without consent

- Masking and Anonymization
	- pseudonymization
	- Stripping or replacing data that can identify (redaction)
		- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
		- Payment card information (PCI-DSS)
		- Intellectual Property (ITAR & EAR)

## Additional Privacy Concepts
- Information Life Cycle
	- Data at rest
		- Readily available data
		- Moving data to less availability when used less
		- To archive
		- Disposition
- Impact Assessment
	- Data privacy
	- Data at rest / transit
- Terms of agreement
	- Shared responsibilty or data in transit / rest
	- Provider responsibility in SLA /  privacy agreement
- Privacy Notices
	- Bank / Insurance company / Health provider
	- How data is dealt with
	- May come after change to legislation
