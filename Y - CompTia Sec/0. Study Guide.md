# 1. Security
- DAD Triad
	- Disclosure
		- Exposure of sensitive info to unauthorized
	- Alteration
		- Unauthorized modification
	- Denial
		- Disruption of legitimate access

- Security Control Categories
	- Technical
		- Enforce CIA
		- Tuning IPS, firewall rules
	- Operational
		- Manage tech in secure manner. Log monitoring, vuln management, user access review
	- Managerial
		- Mechanics of risk management process. Risk assessments

- Security Control Types:
	- Preventive
		- Before issue (firewall)
	- Detective
		- IDS
	- Corrective
		- Backups from ransomware attack
	- Deterrent
		- Guards
	- Physical
		- Guard
	- Compensating
		- mitigate risk for exceptions

- Data in processing: actively in  use on computer

- DLP
	- Host based DLP
		- Software that looks for sensitive info
	- Network DLP
		- Device monitors outbound traffic
	- Pattern mathcing
	- Watermarking
		- Apply electronic tags to sensitive documents. DLP can then monitor

- Data Obfuscation
	- Tokenization
		- replace sensitive values using lookup table
	- Masking
		- Partially redact sensitive information

- Desired Security State
	- Control objectives

- A. PCI DSS compensating controls must be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. This specifically bans the use of a control used to meet one requirement as a compensating control for another requirement

## 2. Landscape

- Shadow IT
	- Personnel using unapproved software like file sharing

- OSINT
	- Senki
	- Open threat exchange
	- MISP
	- CISA (Cybersecurty and Infrastructure Security Agency)

- Threat Indicator Management and Exchange
	- STIX
		- Structured Threat Information eXpression
		- Threat description language
		- XML
		- Sponsored by US department of homeland security
		- 12 domain objects
			- Attack patterns, identities, malware, threat actors, and tools
			- relationship or sighting
		- JSON descriptions
		- Now with OASIS (Organisation for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards)
		-  TAXII protocol (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information)
			- Communicate threat information at application layer
	- OpenIOC
		- XML
		- metadata like the author, the name of the IOC, and a description of the indicator
		- Compromise indicator framework
	- **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs**) help infrastructure owners and operators share threat information and provide tools and assistance to their members. The National Council of ISACs lists the sector-based ISACs

- Threat information
	- Timliness, accuracy, relevance

## 3. Malicious Code

- Botnets
	- Many use IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
	- fast flux DNS
		- register and deregister DNS

- logic bomb
	- function or code placed inside a program

- Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)

- ML / AI
	- Tainted data

- VBSCript works within an application
