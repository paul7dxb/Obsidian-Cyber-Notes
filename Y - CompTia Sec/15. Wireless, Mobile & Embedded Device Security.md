		- Relative movement
		- Time transfer

## Mobile Device Types
- MicroSD HSM
	- Hardware Security Module
	- Common with Android devices
	- RSA and ECC crypto keys
	- Secure mobile wallets

- SEAndroid
	- Android using SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux)
	- Compartmentalize services / logs
	- Reduce effect of malware

## Mobile Deployment Models
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
	- Own ndevice to access enterprise data and systems
	- Options
		- Unlimited access
		- Only to non sensitive
		- Access with IT control
		- preventing local storage

- CYOD Choose Your Own Device
	- BYOD but only for approved devices

- COPE Corporate Owned Personally Enabled
	- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221014064526.png)

- VDI (Virtual Desktop interfaces)
	- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221014064602.png)

## Mobile Device Management (MDM)

- EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management)
	- Secure configuartion of technology stack
	- Reduce risk
	- Allow access from nearly alll locations
	- Using wide variety of mobile devices
	- EMM = MDM + MAM
		- MDM (Mobile Device Managament)
			- Onboarding, offboarding
			- Finding lost devices
			- Remote wiping
			- Locking
			- Certificates
		- MAM (Mobile Application Management)
		- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221014071510.png)
