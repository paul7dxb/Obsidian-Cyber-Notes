# 15. Wireless, Mobile & Embedded Device Security

## Wireless Cryptographic & Authentication Protocols
- WiFi Protected Access (WPA)
	- 802.11b/g/n/ac
	- Temporary fix for WEP
	- TKIP for encryption
	- Depricated
- WPA 2
	- Require certification from WiFi alliance
	- Supports PSK
- WPA 3
	- Require PMF (Protected Management Frames)
	- Natural password selection
	- Forward secrecy
- WPA 3 Personal
	- SAE

- CCMP: Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining
	- 48 bit IV

- x509v3 certificates
- TLS most difficult to deploy
	- Highest security
	- Requires certificates

WPA2 TKIp replaced with AES
- WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)
	- Should be turned off in corporate environment
- Wireless Captive Portals
	- Used in hotels, airports
	- Registration before acess to public wifi
