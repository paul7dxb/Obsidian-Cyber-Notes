# 5. Security Concepts in Enterprise Environment

## Configuration Management
- Diagrams & Topologies
- Baselines
- Schemas
- Naming and Tagging
	- 0 Labelling laptops
	- 1 Metadata labels

Change Management
- Changes should be logged

Change Management Lifecycle
- Submitting
- Approving
- Documenting
	- 0 Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
- Testing
- Implementing
	- 0 Schedule of change
	- 1 Milestones
	- 2 Automation through orchestration software
- Reporting

## Data Sovereignty
- Sensitive data in different jurisdications or global regions
- ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations)
- Export Administration Regulation (EAR)

- Cloud computing Geolocation
	- 0 May need to restrict cloud usage dependant on region
	- 1 MAy need to use cloud physically located in specific region

## Data Protection
- Steps to protect data
- Labeling
- Handling
- Least privilege
- Data at rest vs data in motion
- Tokenization of mobile devices
	- 0 Enterprise Mobility Management = MAM + MDM (Mobile Application Management) (Mobile Device Management)
- Manage the loss and leakage beyond established domain
- Redacting

- Data
- Can leak
- To an outsider
- Resulting in a breach

## Hardware Security Module
- Crypto processor
- Haredened and tamper resistence
- Manage, process, generate and store keys for PKI, SSH
- Verify digital certificates

## Geographical Considerations
- Where to store offsite data and backups
- Cloud HSM may not be allowed and need pysical HSM on site
- Legal considerations for area
- Consideration
	- 0 Jurisdiction
	- 1 Privacy laws
	- 2 Import-export restrictions
	- 3 Cryptography

## Cloud Security Brokers
- Cloud Access Securiity Brokers
	- 0 Between customer and
	- 1 SAAS - Software as a service

## Response and Recovery Controls
- Risk Response
	- 0 Accept
	- 1 Mitigate
	- 2 Transfer/share
	- 3 Avoid (avoid actions that introduce risk)
- Security guards
- Incident Response Team
- Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
- Backups and snapshots
- Remote wiping mobiles
- Recovery plans
- Determin RTO and RPO (Recovery Time/Point Objective)
- Disaster recovery sites

## SSL / TLS Inspection
- Secure Sockets Layering
- Transport Layer Security
	- 0 Keep up to date
	- 1 Conrol browsers that can connect
	- 2 Perfrom certficate revocation checks
	- 3 Verify encryption
	- 4 Use trusted authorities
	- 5 Pinning and OCSP stapling

## Hasking and API
- Crypto strength is half of key length
- Apply forward secrecy
- AES-256-GCM has built in hash authentication
- API Consideration
	- 0 Digitally sign API calls
	- 1 Do not embed credentials
	- 2 Only connect to trusted sources
	- 3 Protect secret keys
	- 4 Secure codign practices

## Site Resilliency
- Site resilience
- Capacity of a network to recover and continue operations
	- 0 Cold site - power only
	- 1 Warm site - some hardware, wired ethernet, some personnel
	- 2 Hot site (mirrored) - parallel site, enough duplicate hardware/software
	- 3 Mobile site
	- 4 Hybrid cloud

## Deception and Disruption
- Honeypots
- Honeynet
- Honeyfiles. Mainly used to catch privileged insider
- Fake telemetry
	- 0 Use trap assets
	- 1 fake data
	- 2 no legit person should be accessing these
	- 3 DNS sinkhole
