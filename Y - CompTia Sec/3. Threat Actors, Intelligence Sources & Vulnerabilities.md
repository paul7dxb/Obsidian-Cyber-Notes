# 3. Threat Actors, Intelligence Sources & Vulnerabilities

## Actors & Threats
- Threat agents are the persons, systems, techniques that acts to support threat or exploit
- All malware are exploits nnot all exploits are malware
- Individual or group
- APT
	- Long term
	- Pre planned with cost benefit
	- Often state actors
	- Muli phased polymorphic
- Human error
- cognitive threats

## Attributes & Actors
- Internal or external
- Structured  
	- Planned, organised
	- Persistent
	- Multi phased
- Unstructured
	- Usually accidental
- Motivation
- skill set
- Probablity of action

## Threat Vectors
- Physical access (removable media)
	- switches, routers, firewalls
	- Closets
- VPN
- Wireless
- Enterprise WPA
- Messaging
- File transfer access
- Other connected enterprises
- Key access (API)
- Single sign on multi FA

## Threat Intelligence Sources
- Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
	- Cyber observable
	- Forensic aretfact
	- Registry entry, new files
	- Meurasble event
- Vulnerability database
	- Needs rapid distribution
	- CVE / MITRE
- Dark Web
- OSINT
	- maltego
	- theHarvester

## Research Sources
- Vendor sites
- Conferences
- IEEE RFC
- Industry
- Social media

## Cloud vs On-Premise Vulnerabilities
- Cloud
	- Threat actors likely external
	- Access keys
	- Many accounts reduce attack surface
- On premise
	- Biggest threat is privileged insider
	- Access beyond role

## Zero Day Vulnerabilities
- Malware or exploit
- zero day when they are discovered
- When vendor is made aware of exploit's existence

## Weak Configurations
- Human error biggest vulnerability
- Better to automate
- Weak encryption
- Unsecure protocols
- Default settings
- Improperly Configured Users
	- Least privilege policy
- Seperate admin accounts
- Auditing
	- ISE
- Shared accounts

## Third Party Risks
- Vendor Management
- System integration
- Lack of vendor support
- Supply chain security
	- Manufacture through to delivery to organisation
- Outsourced code development
	- Adequate testing
- Data Storage
	- Encrypted AES-256 GCM
	- Access Contor

## Improper Patch Managment
- Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
- Configuration Items (CI)
- Select personnel with rights to test, apply and determine urgency of patches

## Legacy Platforms
- Data loss, breach and exfiltration
	- Use of containers
	- Use of lifecycle
- Scripts available on old devices
- IoT devices use old OS and rearely patched
- DOS vulnerable
