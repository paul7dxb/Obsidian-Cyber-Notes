# 16. Organizational Security Assessment Tools & Mitigation Controls

## Network Reconnaissance & Discovery

- ping
	- TCP
	- Resolves name by DNS
- tracert / pathping
- nslookup
	- Ask DNS server to resolve IP or name
	- non authoratative means not gathered from source domain zone (its cached)
- DNSenum
	- Enumeration tool looking for DNS servers and entries
- ipconfig
- netstat
	- TCP and UDP information
	- Socket info `<IP>:<PORT>`
- arp
	- Show resolutions of IP to MAC `arp -a`
- route
	- Show route table
- hping
	- TCP/IP packet assembler
	- tracert mode
	- testing networks and hosts
	- Discover path MTU
- netcat
	- Read and write data TCP or UDP
	- Can create connection
- curl
	- data transfer
	- Internet transfer
- theHarvester
	- OSINT
	- email, subdomains, hosts, employees, open ports
- cuckoo sandbox
	- automated malware analysis system
	- generates report
	- isolated environment
- nmap
	- discovery and security auditing
	- raw IP packets
	- nmap suite
		- zenmap, ncat, ndiff, nping
- Nessus
	- Vulnerability scanner
	- Free version Essentials
- sn1per
	- Penetration scanning utility
	- open source tools to enumerate and scan for vulnerabilities

## Packet Capture & Replay Tools
- tcpreplay
	- modify and reiterate already captured traffic
- tcpdump
	- output explanation of IP packets
	- -r read -w write
	- expression based
- wireshark
	- packet analyzer
	- Used to be called ethereul

## File Manipulation Tools
- logger
	- Add log files to /var/log/syslos from the command line, scripts or files

## Shell & Script Environments

- Secure shell
	- Symmetric encryption fo data encryption
	- Asymmetric algorithms for key exchange (DH)
	- Example Cisco
		- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221014161131.png)
- Powershell
	- configuration and automation management framework
	- cmdlets, filenames, variables
- OpenSSL
	- Toolkit for SSL and TLS protocols
	- General purpose cryptography library

## Forensic Tools
- dd
	- Write disk image file to removable storage
	- Create Bootable USB stick
	- Compress disk image files
	- Install and restore
- memdump
	- Extract files from memory dumps
	- Supports any binary file
	- Automated signature based searching
	- Profiles for file types
- FTK imager
	- Data preview and imaging
	- ELectronic evidence
	- Create forensic images (drive, volume, SID)
	- **Uses write-blocking methods**
- WinHex
	- Hexidecimel editor
	- Can recover deleted files
	- Recover from corrupted drives
- Autopsy
	- Used by law enforcement
	- Hard drive investigation framework

## Exploitation Kits and Password Crackers
- EK (Exploitation kits)
	- Specialize per compoenent e.g router, powershell
	- RIG EK, RIG-v
		- trojans, coin miners
	- Grandsoft EK
	- GreenFlash Sundown
		- Uses flash player
	- Ransomware EKs
- Password crackers
	- Brute force onlne/offline
	- Dictionaries
	- Word lists
	- Rainbow tables
	- Tools
		- Cain
		- johntheripper

## Endpoint Security Solution Reconfiguration Methods
- Reconfiguring Endpoint Security Solutions
	- Applicatiuon whitelisting
		- Only allow certain programs
		- Certain browsers and versions
		- Firewall always on
		- No split tunnel
	- Application blacklisting
		- social media
	- Quarantine and remediation

## Configuration Changes For Mitigation
- Firewall rules and WAF webACLS
	- Tested and updated
- MDM up to date (mobile device management)
- URL and content filtering
- Data loss prevention
	- keywords from campaigns etc
- Revoking and updating certificates

## Isolation, Containment & Segmentation
- Reduce the attack surface
- ORganisation have OUs with many accounts for different projects, data
- Containerise with different policies
- Create sub networks
- Avoid flat topologies with end to end management
- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221014180748.png)
- Can still keep same subnet with private vlans
	- Commuinicate upstream to router but can't talk to each other
	- Layer 2 segmentation
- Helps prevent virus spreading through frames
- 8802.1ae - MAC sec for frames

## Secure Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR)
- Colect data and alerts from sources
- Threat analysis and remediation
- Describe priortize and support incident response
- Technology vectors
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221014181056.png)
	- Orchestration manages automation tasks
- SOAR playbooks
	- Checklist of procedures to respond to incident and threats
	- step by step
	- ensures steps systematically followed
	- human and automation
- SOAR runbook
	- conduct actions as a function of response
	- Support automation
	- Optimise incident response
	- Primarily action based
