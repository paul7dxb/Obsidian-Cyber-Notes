# 6. Implementing Cybersecurity Resilience

## Redundancy Concepts
- Passive. Uses additional capacity to reduce impact of component failures
- Active. Similtaneous capacity in use. Hot/parallel sites
- Geograpical dispersal
- RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
	- 0 RAID 0 - Data split between disks. No redundancy. Striping.
	- 1 RAID 1 - Mirroring. Same data. Slow write
	- 2 RAID 5 - atleast 3 drives. Striped with parity
	- 3 RAID 6 - RAID 5 but with 2 parity data. webserver. Not for heavy writing
	- 4 RAID 10 - mirroring and striping (1&2 stripe and mirror onto 3&4)

- Network Load Balancer
	- 0 In cloud can grow horizontally
- Redundant Power

## Replication Methods
- SAN: Storage Area Network
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221011054353.png)
	- IPsec AH for integrity and origin authentication for data in transit
	- Encrypt with AES-256-GCM
- Virtualisation
	- Hypervisors control interaction between VMs and 
	- Type 1 - bare metal
	- Type 2 - hosted hypervisor on OS (ontop of Windows)
	- Vulnerabilities
		- VM sprawl
		- VM escape. Interacts directly with host OS or hypervisor
	- Containers
		- Isolated abstracted applications
		- Package up applications with all dependencies as a package
		- Consistent experience
		- Immutable
		- Docker / Kubernetes

## Backup Types
- Full backup
- Incremental backup
	- Only archive bit set, new or updated file
	- Clears archive bit onve backup complete
	- Slowest to restore, need all backups
- Differential backup
	- Does not clear archive bit once complete
	- Last full backup and most recent differential needed
- Snapshot
	- Immediate point in time copy
	- Improved RTO and RPO

## Non-persistence Concepts
- Revert to known state
- Last known good config (before win 10)
- Live boot media
	- Security threat if regular users can live boot

## High Availability Concepts
- Availability
	- System uptime
	- Ability to access
- Durability
	- Long term data protection: degregation
	- 11 9's to 16 9's
- Scalability
	- Ability to increase workload on current hardware
	- Scale up
- Elasticity
	- Ability to increase workload on its current and additionally added on demand hardware resources
	- Scale out

## Order of Restoration
- Repair hard drive
- Image drive to new disk image file
- Recovery of files from clone
- Repair damaged files

- DRP Restoration
	- Protect people and critical assets
	- Sustain ongoing operational viability
	- Financial stability
	- Deliver profitability

## Diversity Concepts
Avoiding single point of failure:
- Technologies
- Vendors
- Cryptosystems
- Controls
