# 13. Implementing Secure Protocols & Application Security Solutions

## Types of Secure Protocols
- DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)
	- Protects from DNS attacks
	- Systems detect DNS attacks
	- Provides authentication (PKI)
	- Provides integrity
	- Does not provide confidentiality
	- Root DNS server helps verify domain
	- New record types
		- RRSIG: crypto singature
		- DNSKEY: public signing key
		- DS: hash of DNSKEY record
		- NSEC / NSEC3: explicit denail of existence
		- CDNSKEY / CDS: CHild zone requesting updates to DS in parent
- SSH (Secure Shell)
	- SSH2 
		- Uses symmetric encryption
		- DH key exchange
- S/MIME
	- Email message security
	- Digital signatures
	- Encryption
	- Triple wrapping

- Secure RTP
	- Telephone
	- Encryption, integrity and authentication
- LDAPS (lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
	- LDAP over SSL / TLS
	- Port TCP 636
	- SASL (Simple Authenication and Security Layer)
- FTPS
	- FTP with SSL/TLS
	- Usually server to server
	- AES, RSA/DSA and X509v3 certificates
	- Explicit
		- Selected parts encrypted
	- Implicit
		- All encrypted
- SFTP
	- FTP over SSH2 channel
	- Both commands and data encrypted
	- Platform independent
	- Slower than SCP
- SNMPv3

- SSL/TLS
	- Transport Layer Security
	- Certificate based
	- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221013080559.png)
- HTTPS
	- HTTP over SSL/TLS
- POPS / IMAPS
	- IMAPS port 993
	- POP3 port TCP 995

## Features of IPsec
- Security crossing untrusted networks
- IPSec VPN
- Connecting to cloud services
- ![](ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221013082312.png)
- Functions
	- Confidentiality
	- Data Integrity
	- Origin Authentication
	- Anti-replay
		- Compares sequence numbers with sliding window
	- Key management
	- Operates in tunnel or transport mode
		- Transport: between sites
- Requires matching security suite (ESP / DES)
- Optional in IPv4 but mandatory in IPv6
	- ESP or AH

## Types of use cases
- TLS use
	- Voice and video security
	- NTP (Network time protocol)
	- Signed API calls
	- Router and switch authentication
		- VPN gateways
		- 802.1X (PNAC) or MACSEC
	- DNS
	- Email
	- Remote access
	- File transfer
	- LDAPS / Kerberos
	- Network Address allocation DHCPv6

## Endpoint Protection
- Acceptable Use Policy
- Physical Security Controls
	- Administrative (managerial)
	- Technical
	- Physical
		- Locking mechanisms
		- Lock screen
		- Removable device policy
		- MFA
		- Locked cabinets
		- Client side encryption
- Hardware and Software Updates
	- WSUS, Silverlight
	- Digitally signed updates
	- Manufacturer firmware updates
- Personal Security Suites
	- All in one solution
	- One vendor for updates
- Web Browsing
	- Plug ins
	- EV validated sites (green padlock)
	- Clear history
	- Dont store passwords in browser
	- VPN

- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
	- Detect IOC's on hosts and endpoints
		- Send to SIEM or database for analysis
	- Filtering
	- Blocking
	- Incident Response
	- Multi-threat protection
- Next-gen Endpoint Protection
