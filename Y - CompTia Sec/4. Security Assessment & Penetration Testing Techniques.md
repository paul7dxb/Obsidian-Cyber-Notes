# 4. Security Assessment & Pen Testing Techniques

## Threat Hunting
- Visibilty
- Analyse
- Hypothesis
- Hunt analytic
- analyse
- follow up
- Revise

## Vulnerability Scanning Technology
- Identifying known and unkown waknesses
- Intrusive active
- Passive
- Unpatched, misconfigured, open  ports

- Ture positive: Found + action taken
- True Negative: found + no action

- Logs
- SNMP traps
- Netflow
- SIEM Security Information and event managment
- SOAR
- NGIPS

CVE
- Common Vulnerabilites and exposures
	- ID
	- Description and reference

CVSS
- Weigh severity of vulnerability
- 0-10

## Vulnerability Scanning Tools
- Nessus
- OWASP ZAP
- Burpsuite
- Network scanning
	- Rogue IP, AP, DHCP
	- Ports
	- Locations
	- Wireless
	- Issues and outages
- Compliance Scanner
	- Auditing
	- Checks in configured to agreed standard

## Syslog & SIEM
- syslog trap
	- one way
- Informs
- UDP 514 or TCP 1468
- Severity categories
	- 0 emergency
	- 1 alert
	- 2 critical
	- 3 error
	- 4 warning
	- 5 notice
	- 6 information
	- 7 Debug
- Shouldn't be single point of failure
- 

## Pen Testing Terminology
- Black box is testing without any prior knowledge
- White box
	- 0 Detailed investigation of systems
	- 1 often have full knowledge
- Credentialed testing (given user account to use). Gives more comprehensive testing results
 black box
	- No prior knowledge to tester
- White box
	- Detailed investigation of internal logic
	- Full knowledge of systems and network usually known
- Greybox
	- Some limited knowledge
- Credentialed
	- Give existing account (white/grey)
- Intrusive / non intrusive
- In line / promiscuous

## Pen Testing Fundamentals
- Phases
	- ROE agreement
	- Recon and engagement
	- Priv esc
	- Pivoting / Lateral movement
	- Persistence
	- Clean up

## Active Recon
- Fingerprinting
- Nessus
- Burpsuite 
- Banner grabbing
- Port and address scanning

## Priv esc
- Check OS and kernel version
- Check users and current privilege
- List SUID files
- View installed packages and services for vuln version

## Exercise Teams
- Purple team
	- 0 Improving organisation
- Blue team
	- 0 Implementing controls
	- 1 Incident response
	- 2 Security monitoring
