- Which protocol
	- Protocol digital;ly signs packet header
	- Encrypts and encapsulates packets

- STIX/TAXI ISAC source of info
	- AIS (Automated Indicator Sharing)

- Recent software and security vulns from last week
	- DHS Automated Indicator Sharing Database

- MAC filtering
	- Restrict client access

- Embedded Firewall
	- Firewall in a router

- Application Change Control Process:
	- Request
	- Analyze
	- Record request
	- Submit for approval
	- Make changes
	- Submit to management

- Security Management Lifecycle
	- Completing audits to meet baseline: Monitor and evaluate

- Avoid accepting invalid keys
	- OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
	- Real time protocol

- Partitioning access to database
	- Database View
		- Limit user and group access
		- Partitioning splits database into parts

- Firewall type most detrimental to network performance:
	- Applciation level

- SLE = EF x asset value

- Using facebook login
	- OAuth

- packet sniffing
	- Replace hub with switch

- Remote attacks -> internet

- Access mobile phones emails, contacts
	- Bluetooth

- evidence life cycle
	- Collect
	- Analyze
	- Store
	- Present
	- Return

- CCTV is detective

- Kerberos who authenticates
	- AS (authentication Service)
		- Grants TGT sent to computer with TGS
		- CS : CLient server

- Key stretching
	- PBKDF2
	- Bcrypt


- RSA give asymmetric with authentication
	- Uses PKI

- buffer overflow check
	- Execute well written program

- Single sign on
	- Active Directory
	- SESAME
	- Kerberos

- Vishing
	- Phising ove VoIP

- Ensuring transactions occur in all databases
	- Two-phase commit

- Certificate based authentication card
	- PIV (Prsoanl Identity Verification)

- Order of access control
	- Identification, authentication, authorization


- base 64 certificate type
	- DER
	- Certifates:
		- DER Distinguished Encoding Rules

			- Export file acts as parent
		- P7B
			- Base 64
			- Used by CA to provide chains to clients
		- P12
			- Used by Microsoft
			- P12 and PFX common file types to export private key
		- PEM Primary Enhanced Mail
			- Web servers
			- Base 64
			- Converted to PEM through SSL
		- CER Canonical Encoding Rules
			- encrypted base 64
