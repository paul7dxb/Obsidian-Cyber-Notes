## Incident Response Plans & Processes
- steps taken when incident effects normal operations
	- Event or incident
- Goals
	- Reduce impact
	- maintatin operations
	- provide LIs
	- Deter future attacks
- Processes
	- Be prepared
		- Documented types
		- Risk assessments
		- BIA Business Impact ANalysis
		- Method of escalation
		- Contact lists
	- CSIRT (Cyber Incidient Response Team)
		- Outsourced or internal swarm team
- Lifecycle
	- Preperation
		- Info gathering
		- missions
		- roles and responsibilites on IRT
		- processes of communication
		- Conduct IR exercises
		- Training on security policies
	- Identification
		- Seperate event from an incident breach
		- Categorizing and priortization based on risk register or risk ledger
			- When
			- How alerted
			- WHo discovered
			- SCope
			- escalation or disaster recovery
			- Root cause
	- Containment
		- Seperation and containment
			- Short term processes (disconnecting)
			- Firewall logs
			- Forensic tools
		- Evaluate backups for future recovery
	- Eradication
		- Determine root cause
		- Apply remedies
		- Remove all IoC, artefacts, fingerprints from attack
	- Recovery
		- Restore negatively effected data to **baseline** performance level or previous stete
		- Make sure not in danger of another breach
	- Lessons Learned

## Incident Response Exercises
- Plan review (read-through)
	- Discussion auditing plan
	- Delphi method
- Tabletop
	- Virtual walkthroughs
	- identify gaps, errors and trainging neeeded
- Walkthrough (exercise)
	- Rehersals and drills
		- OFten done in stages, building / department one at a time
- Simulation
	- Specific scenarios
	- Use real BCP (Business Continuty Planning) and DRP (Disaster Recover Planning) resources and teams
	- Test snapshot and hot spares
	- High level test
- Parallel
	- Real world drill while still operating business
	- Resource intensive
- Full Interuption
	- Ceasing business activities
	- Cost prohibitive for most

## Attack Frameworks

- **Cyber Kill Chain**
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221015081333.png)
	- Better understand malware
	- Lockhead Martin
- 7 Phase Cyber kill chain
	- Botnets, RAT
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221015081434.png)

- **MITRE ATT&CK**
	- Practices based on real-world interpretations
	- Generating threat modeling and threat assessment tools
	- Enterprise matrix commonly used aas a starting point
	- Steps
		- Initial access
		- Execution
		- Persistence
		- Privilege escalation
		- Defence evasion
		- Credential Access
		- Discovery
		- Lateral Movement
		- Collection
			- Collection of data
		- Command & Contorl
			- Application level protocols
		- Exfiltration
			- Includes deleting, wiping, modifying

- ** Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**
	- Granular attacker activities generates a model
	- Helps classify motivation, victims and technologies under attack
	- Element
		- Adversary
		- Infrastructure
			- IP, domains, email
		- Capability
			- Malware, exploits, manipulation tools
		- Victim
			- People, data, systems
