## Incident Response Plans & Processes
- steps taken when incident effects normal operations
	- Event or incident
- Goals
	- Reduce impact
	- maintatin operations
	- provide LIs
	- Deter future attacks
- Processes
	- Be prepared
		- Documented types
		- Risk assessments
		- BIA Business Impact ANalysis
		- Method of escalation
		- Contact lists
	- CSIRT (Cyber Incidient Response Team)
		- Outsourced or internal swarm team
- Lifecycle
	- Preperation
		- Info gathering
		- missions
		- roles and responsibilites on IRT
		- processes of communication
		- Conduct IR exercises
		- Training on security policies
	- Identification
		- Seperate event from an incident breach
		- Categorizing and priortization based on risk register or risk ledger
			- When
			- How alerted
			- WHo discovered
			- SCope
			- escalation or disaster recovery
			- Root cause
	- Containment
		- Seperation and containment
			- Short term processes (disconnecting)
			- Firewall logs
			- Forensic tools
		- Evaluate backups for future recovery
	- Eradication
		- Determine root cause
		- Apply remedies
		- Remove all IoC, artefacts, fingerprints from attack
	- Recovery
		- Restore negatively effected data to **baseline** performance level or previous stete
		- Make sure not in danger of another breach
	- Lessons Learned

## Incident Response Exercises
- Plan review (read-through)
	- Discussion auditing plan
	- Delphi method
- Tabletop
	- Virtual walkthroughs
	- identify gaps, errors and trainging neeeded
- Walkthrough (exercise)
	- Rehersals and drills
		- OFten done in stages, building / department one at a time
- Simulation
	- Specific scenarios
	- Use real BCP (Business Continuty Planning) and DRP (Disaster Recover Planning) resources and teams
	- Test snapshot and hot spares
	- High level test
- Parallel
	- Real world drill while still operating business
	- Resource intensive
- Full Interuption
	- Ceasing business activities
	- Cost prohibitive for most

## Attack Frameworks

- **Cyber Kill Chain**
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221015081333.png)
	- Better understand malware
	- Lockhead Martin
- 7 Phase Cyber kill chain
	- Botnets, RAT
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221015081434.png)

- **MITRE ATT&CK**
	- Practices based on real-world interpretations
	- Generating threat modeling and threat assessment tools
	- Enterprise matrix commonly used aas a starting point
	- Steps
		- Initial access
		- Execution
		- Persistence
		- Privilege escalation
		- Defence evasion
		- Credential Access
		- Discovery
		- Lateral Movement
		- Collection
			- Collection of data
		- Command & Contorl
			- Application level protocols
		- Exfiltration
			- Includes deleting, wiping, modifying

- ** Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**
	- Granular attacker activities generates a model
	- Helps classify motivation, victims and technologies under attack
	- Element
		- Adversary
		- Infrastructure
			- IP, domains, email
		- Capability
			- Malware, exploits, manipulation tools
		- Victim
			- People, data, systems

## Plan Types for the Incident Response Team (IRT)
- BCP (Business Continuity Planing)
- COOP (Continuity of Operations)
	- Ensure business operates at a pre determined level
	- Approved by executive management
	- Populates risk register/lodger
- NIST SP 800-34, Revision 1
	- Develop continuity planning policy statement
	- Conduct BIA (Business Impact Analaysis)
	- Identify preventive controls
	- Contingency strategies
	- Contingency plan for imformation system
	- Training
	- After-action report
	- Plan maintenece
- ![](../ZZ%20-%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221015084515.png)
- Elements
	- Business Impact Analaysis (BIA)
	- Disaster Recover Planning (DRP)
		- Ensure company can recover to baseline
		- Tasks and processes to be conducted
		- Outlines technical aspects involved
			- Order of restoration
			- Backup strategy
			- Details on how to restore data
			- Contact information
			- Communication plans and strategies
			- Chain of Authority
			- Location of documents, credentials, software
	- Backup / Restore (BU/R)

- IRT 
	- CSIRT (Computer Security IRT)
	- Recieve alerts of breaches
	- Internal or external

## Forensic Documentation & Evidence
- Scientific investigation of cyber incident
- Standardized manner
	- Pre planned
	- Evidence collection
	- Analysis of evidence
	- Reporting
- Collection of evidence
	- Capture system images
	- Use write-blockers so no fingerprint
	- Netwrok traffic and logs
		- SIEM
	- Timeline of event sequence
	- Video and picture
	- Record time offsets
	- Take hashes of data and artifacts
		- For chain of custody
			- Follows evidence through lifecycle
			- Collecting, handling and tagging
			- Timeline of handling
			- Maintain integrity and accountablility
			- Legal holds
				- Do not delete documents
	- Witness interviews
- Forensic Techniques
	- Validation
		- Encrypted volume detection
	- Filtering
	- Pattern matching
	- Hidden data discovery
	- Extract images using write-blockers
	- Tracing

## Forensic Acquisition Concepts & Sources
- Order of Volatility
	- CPU and its Cache
	- Kernel statistics, arp caches
	- RAM
	- Temporary file systems, swap/slack space (SSD)
	- Disk Drives
	- Attached removable drives
	- Logged data to remote location
		- SIEM
	- Copies of data archived media/cloud

- Know OS
- Firmware attacks
- Encrypted snapshots
	- Offline analysis and decryption
	- Remenants of atrefacts for investigation

## Digital Forensic Techniques

- Foresnsic terms
	- Integrity
		- Hashing for chain of integrity
		- HMAC
	-  Provenance
		- Lineage and history of evidence
		- IPS and anomoly detection
		- Time base database for immutable data
	- Preservation
		- Forensic bags. Labelled and sealed
	- e-Discovery
		- Lower risks and costs associated with big data
		- Phases

			- Sorting through data by relevance
				- ML
			- Create production sets
			- Data management
	- Data recovery
		- Non repudiation with digital certificates
