# 7. Virtualization, Cloud computing & Cloud Cybersecurity

## Virtualization basics & VM Security
- Hypervisors
	- Software that makes and manages virtual infrastructure
	- Controls resources
- Type 1 Hypervisor
	- Bare metal / metal
	- Blade / rack mounted
- Type 2 Hypervisor
	- Host OS on top of hardware
	- Hypervisor on top of OS
- Vulnerabilites
	- VM Sprawl
		- Number of VM's becomes unmanageable
		- Enforce strict policy including who can deply VM's
	- VM  escape
		- Guest VM interact with host VM in unintended way

## Cloud Models
![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221011064719.png)
- Cost saving 
- Elasticity and Agility
- Broad Access
- IaaS
	- Processing, storage and networks for arbitrary software
	- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221011064445.png)
- PaaS (Platform as a service)
	- Consumer doesn't manage cloud infrastructure
	- Development platforms
	- Container services
	- Managed databases
	- Security
- SaaS (Software as a service)
	- Use provider's applications on cloud
	- Usually interact with application through a browser
- Private cloud
	- Personal information, credit card info
- Public cloud
	- For customer consumption
- Community cloud
- Hybrid cloud

## Cloud Service Provider
- MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)
	- Outsourced security monitoring and management
- Fog Computing
	- Place resources close to where they are needed
- Microservices
	- Small self contained form part of larger applications with API
	- Modular and independantly deployable

## Infrastructure as Code
- Use template language e.g YAML or JSON

## Containerisation
- Include all components needed
- Portable
- Libraries can be across containers
- Replace container instead of updating

- Docker vs Kubernetes
	![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221011073527.png)

Use docker to deploy and then kubernetes to scale after deployment

## Serverless Architecture
- CSP handles all server overhead
- Services Integration
	- Take value of delivered services
	- Integration platform software
		- Handle complex integration
	- iPaaS
		- Integration Platform as a Service
	- SaaS vendor tooling
		- plug ins integrate between application
	- Custom coding
		- Team creates integration
	- Function Platform as a Service (fPaaS)
		- Create suite of integration tools

## Transit Gateways
- Connect on premise networks to single component
- Connect different VPNs
- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221011074047.png)

## Cloud Storage Security
- Block and object storage
- Secrets Management
- Data publicly access through URL or API calls
- data in rest can be server side encrypted
- Can use client side encryption and send to service
- High availablilty and fault tolerence

## Cloud Network Security
- Public or private subnets
- DDoS solutions
- ![](Z.%20Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020221011080841.png)
- WAF with deep packet inspection
- Site to site VPN's

## Cloud Compute Security
- Private subnets and firewalls
- Cloud functions enhance security
- Single source of truth
- Container secuirty by design

OWASP top10 IoT
- Weak passwords
- Insecure network services
- Insecure ecosystem interfaces
- Lack os secure update mechanism
- Insecure or outdated components
- Insufficient privacy protection
- Insecure data transfer
- Lack of device management
- Insecure default settings
- Lack of physical hardening
