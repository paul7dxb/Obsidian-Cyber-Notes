# 2. Analyzing Application & Network Security
## injection attacks
- RAT - Remote access trojan
- Malware can inject MAC or IP
- DLL injection
- SQLi
- LDAP injection
	- unsanitised or direct to back end
- XML injection / SOAP

## Targeted Coding Attacks
- Pointer / object dereference
	- Supply pointer to memory location unexpected
	- Null reference
	- Crash or read from unintended postiion
- Directory traversal
- Buffer/integer overflow
	- Larger than expected input. Overwrite adjacent memory
- Race conditions
	- Two or more similtaneous things needed to be done specific order
	- Sync error activities
- Time of check / Time of use
	- race condition by racing to resource
- Improper Error and input handling
	- Including collision hashes
- Session replay attack
	- Stealing valid session id

## API attacks
Application programming interface

- API calls not digitally signed
- Login attacks
	- automated attacks
- DDOS attacks
- Leverage credentials
	- Stolen creds or API keys

## Pass the Hash
- Windows vulnerability
	- Dont need PT passwords just the hash
- Safe mode vulnerabilty
- VSM defends against this

## Driver Manipulation
- Shimming
	- Steaoling info and money from point of sales / ATM
- Refactoring

## Wireless attacks
- Evil twins
	- Rogue access point instead of real one
	- MITM
	- honey pot except appear as valid network
- Disassociation Attacks
	- DOS attack against infrastrucre
	- Get client to reauthenticate with your rogue access point
	- Use MPP todefend against / WPA3
- MITM
	- Honeypot
- Jamming
- Weak Inititialisation Vector
	- Easy to crack
	- WEP
		- passive attack crack 24 hours
	- WPA3 dragonfly handshake
		- dragonblood attack patch
- Bluejacking
	- Spoof a name
- Bluesnarfing
	- Steal data through bluetooth
	- Contact/calandar text messagges
	- discoverable vulnerable
- RFID / Near Field Communnication
	- Sniffing , spoofing, replay
	- cloning
	- RFID zapping
	- Relay attacks

## MITM attacks
- Proxy ARP
- DHCP spoofing
- Inject in intended path TCP/UDP
- Simplex or duplex
- Man in the browser
	- trojan used  between browser and libraries

## Layer 2 attacks
- ARP Poisoning
	- MITM
	- Inject false frames
	- only IPv4
	- Mitigate:
		- Port security
		- DHCP snooping
		- Cloud provider hypervisor protection
- MAC flooding
	- macoff
	- flood switchport to fill CAM table
	- DOS
- MAC cloning

## DNS attacks
- Domain hijacking / clickjacking
	- Hijack clicks
- DNS poisoning
	- DNS sserver cache
	- Farming
	- Redirect to different address
- Domain repuation attacks

## DDoS
- DOS
- Consume networkm resources
	- CAM table, bandwidth, DHCP lease
- Simple to conduct
- DDOS
	- zombiefied hosts

## Malicious code or sript execution
- Virus attach to exe
- Worm self replicating
- Script virus
	- Infect other files or part of other code
