## 1. Social Engineering

- Smishing
	- Text messaging
- Vishing
	- Phishing through VoIP
- Watering Hole
	- Infect website often visited by target
	- Multi phased attack
- Pharming
	- Look-a-like website
	- DNS cache poisoning
		- URL is correct

- Typosquatting
	- look-alike URL

- Clickjacking
	- Â attack that tricks a user into clicking a webpage element which is invisible or disguised as another element

- Baiting
	- Leaving USB on floor

- Eliciting
	- Casual conversation
	- Flattery
	- Flase ignorance
	- Incorrect statements

- Prepending
	- putting word in headers (SAFE)
	- Adding info as part of another attack
	- Suggest topics to lead target toward related information

- Pretexting
	- Using made up scenario

- Hybrid warfare as part of influence campaigns

- SPIM
	- SPAM over IM

- Reconnaissance
	- Footprinting
		- Passive collection
	- Scanning
	- Enumeration

- Phishing process
	- Initiation
	- Execution
		- sending
	- User action
	- Completion

## 2. Network Attack

- Evil twin
	- Force reconnection using de authentication or disassociation attack

- Bluetooth
	- Bluejacking
		- unsolicited message
	- Bluesniping
		- Directional antenna to increase bluetooth range
	- Bluesnarfing
		- Connect to device
		- address book, email, text messages
	- Bluecasing / War nibbling
		- unsecured/unpatched bluetooth devices

- RFID
	- Sniffing
	- Cloning then Spoofing using cloned info

- IV attack
	- By learning plain text of one packet try to compute the RC4 keystream generated by the IV

- DNS
	- Poisoning - cache. DNS server returns wrong IP
	- Spoofing - divert dns name to wrong IP

- Man in the browser
	- Trojan web extension
	- MITM between browser and web server

- ping of death
	- size 65500
	- `ping <ip> -t -l 65500`

- Powershell
	- `-ep Bypass` paramter - restricted mode bypassed and script directly loaded and executed from memory

- Virtual Basic for Application (VBA)

## 3. Security tools

- OpenSSL
	- SSL and TLD protocols
	- Key creation
	- CSR
	- X.509 certificates
	- Encryption and decryption
	- S/MIME email

- Forensics
	- dd
		- Creak disk images
	- memdump
		- dump system memory to output stream
	- winhex
		- disk editor and hex editor
	- FTK Imager
		- Imaging tool to preview data
	- Autopsy
		- windows based froensics tool

- Password
	- Crunch
		- Create wordlists
	- ophcrack
		- rainbow table cracking

## 4. Load Balancing

- Active/Active : Two or more working together. Cached requests may error if go back to active balancer with issue
- Active/Passive : One active the other on standby monitoring to take over if there is an issue

- Scheduling
	- Affinity
		- Distrubution dependant on capacity (one with least connections gets next one)
	- Round-robin
		- Cyclically distributed

- Persistence
	- Load balancers can assign cookies and then send clients requests to one web server rather than distributing it

- DMZ
	- A DMZ is a logically separated network from the internal network. It contains servers that need to be accessible externally through the internet
	- Internal to DMZ should be encrypted
		- Goes through firewalls
		- web application DB should be internal

- Zero Trust
	- The Zero trust concept in networking is based on the methodology that all requests received from any device on the network, regardless if it is internally or externally located, must always be authenticated and authorized
