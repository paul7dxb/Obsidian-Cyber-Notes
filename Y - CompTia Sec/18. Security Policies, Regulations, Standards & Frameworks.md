	- Policies
		- How, where and why data is stored
- Data sanitization
	- Degaussing: removing the magnetic field of a drive
	- Purging: clearing everything off the media
	- Wiping: overwrite every sector of drive with 1s and 0s
	- Encryption: Encrypt all files before deletion or disposal of media

## Credential Policies

	- Submitting
	- Approving
	- Documenting
	- Testing
		- Have fallback ready if something goes wrong
	- Implementing
		- Schedule outlined with milestones
	- Reporting
		- Full report to management
- ITIL 4 uses change control
- Standard
	- Low risk, pre authorised
	- Don't need authorisation
- Normal
	- Follow specific process
	- Go through change management process
	- Low risk

## Regulations, Standards & Legislation
- Â Regulatory: 
	- HIPAA is for the medical and insurance industry, 
	- SOX or Sarbanes-Oxley for the financial industry, 
	- GDPR is regulatory for the EU, it's for privacy through the General Data Protection Regulation.

- Non-regulatory would be more for guidance, best practices and guidelines
	- NIST
	- ITIL 4 or ITIL, 
	- ISO/IEC, the International Organization for Standardization, 
	- COBIT5, 
	- CIS, which is the Center for Internet Security, and 
	- ISACA, which is responsible for the CISM, Certified Information Systems Manager, and CISA, Certified Information Systems Auditor,

- Some are country specific
	- US: FISMA, GLBA, COBIT5, HIPAA
	- International: DGDPR, ITIL4, ISO/IEC, AGATE, IDABC

- Industry specific regulations
	- PCI-DSS credit card
	- HIPPA healthcare US

## Key Frameworks
- Non Regulatory guideline
- Gap analysis
	- Center for Internet Secuity (CIS)
	- Commone secure configuration (NIST)
	- International Organisation for Satndardization (ISO)
		- 27001/27002/27701/31000
	- SSAE SOC 2 Type II/III
	- Could Security Alliance (CSA)

## Benchmarks & Secure Configuration Guides
- Benchmarks
	- Technique to improve organistaion's information security management by setting a benchmark

		- Created by government, busines, industry and academia
- Brought in during implementation phase
- Examples

- Speicifc configuration guidelines per system
	- Web server
	- OS
