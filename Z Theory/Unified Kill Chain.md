### Unified Kill Chain (UKC)

- Understanding an attackers killchain can help pre-emptively protect a system.

Threat modelling is identifying risk
- Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment. For example, is the system critical to normal operations, and is a system holding sensitive information like payment info or addresses?
- Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially exploited
- Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted
- Putting in policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occurring again where possible (for example, implementing a software development life cycle (SDLC) for an application or training employees on phishing awareness).
